# KCrypt: Secure Key Management for Multiplatform Apps

KCryp is a Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) library that provides a secure and unified way to manage encryption keys across iOS and Android platforms. It abstracts the complexities of key generation, encryption, and storage, allowing you to focus on building secure and robust multiplatform applications.

## Features

- Unified API: Write your encryption logic once and use it seamlessly across both iOS and Android platforms.
- Secure Key Generation: KCrypt handles the generation of secure encryption keys based on platform-specific best practices.
- Secure Storage: The library securely stores your encryption keys using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (Keychain on iOS and Keystore on Android).
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Build multiplatform applications with shared encryption logic that works consistently on iOS and Android.

## Usage

To get started with KCrypt in your KMM project, follow these steps:

1. Add the KCrypt dependency to your shared module's `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts in the shared module
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation("to-be-added")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2. Use KCrypt in your shared code:

```kotlin
// Shared code
import your.group.id.getKCrypt

val kCrypt = getKCrypt()
val encryptionKey = kCrypt.getEncryptionKey()
```


## Compatibility

KCryp is designed to work with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile projects targeting both iOS and Android platforms.

- Minimum Android version: Android 5.0 (API level 21)
- Minimum iOS version: iOS 9.0
